  #  Week-1-Code-Challenge.
 
This is the Week 1 Code Challenge where I solved Week 1 Toy Problems.
The Toy Problems had three challenges;
 1. Student Grade Calculator
 2. Speed Detector
 3. Net Salary Calculator


# Students-Grade-Generator.js

This JavaScript challenge was to grade student marks between 0 and 100. The output of the grades was as shown below;
  Marks between 80 and 100 are graded as "A"
  Marks between 60 and 79 are graded as "B"
  Marks between 50 and 59 are graded as "C"
  Marks between 40 and 49 are graded as "D"
  Marks below 40 are graded as "E"
Any input marks that are out of scope, that is, below 0 and above 100, the marks are graded as Invalid Grade.


 # Speed-Detector.js

This JavaScript challenge was to compare different ranges of speed limits. A speed limit of 70km/h or below prints an outcome "Ok".
Every 5km/h above the acceptable speed limit, 70km/h, earns 1 demerit Point. Here the output printed is the number of points earned.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the return is "Licence suspended".


 # Net_salary-Calculator.js

This challenge calculates the net salary of an employee  based on their basic salary and benefits. 
The deductions which include, paye, the nhif deductions and nssf deductions are added and the total deducted from Gross salary so as to get the employee net Salary. 



  # Conclusion

I worked on this Week1-Code-Challenge where I wrote code that calculates students' grades and assigns them different grades according to the category the student's grades are.
The second challenge was to write code to detect different speeds and return different values according to the conditions set.
